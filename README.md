# AI-DOOR-BELL

🛎️ AI-DOOR-BELL

An intelligent AI-powered smart doorbell system built using Raspberry Pi, AI vision, and real-time communication.
The system detects visitors, captures snapshots, sends event data to a backend, and allows the owner to interact via a mobile app with AI-assisted replies.

🚀 Features

AI Visitor Detection – Raspberry Pi with camera detects motion/person using AI models.

Snapshot & Metadata Capture – Stores image/video frames with timestamps.

Cloud/Backend Integration – Sends event details to API for storage & processing.

AI Summaries & Replies – Backend generates visitor summaries and smart reply suggestions.

Mobile App Notifications – Real-time push/WebSocket alerts with visitor info.

Interactive Replies – Owner can pick AI-suggested replies or type custom messages.

Raspberry Pi Output – Displays and speaks reply to visitor via TTS (Text-to-Speech).

Event Logging – All interactions are logged for review.
